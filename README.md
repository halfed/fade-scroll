### Description
```
This project was taken from https://itnext.io/make-elements-fade-in-while-scrolling-daily-vue-tip-3-6540dd975c7e.
It is a project designed to have elements fade in when scrolled into view. It was originally built with
Vue Composition API https://learnvue.co/2019/12/a-first-look-at-vue3-a-vue-composition-api-tutorial/.  I have
translated it to Vue.js 2.6 version using regular lifecycle hooks.
